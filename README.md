# Emergency-SOS-App
 
Project Title: Emergency SOS

Description: 
Our cross-platform Emergency SOS app is crafted with one central objective – to safeguard users during emergencies with ease and efficiency. This straightforward application enables individuals to create an account and personalize their emergency contact list, offering a simple yet effective way to seek assistance promptly.

Main Features:
•	Personal Emergency Contacts: Users can effortlessly add and manage their personal emergency contacts within the app. In times of distress, a simple selection allows them to initiate a call directly to their chosen contact using their default mobile calling app.
•	Disaster Categories: The app is equipped with categorized tabs for various emergency scenarios such as health emergencies, landslides, tsunamis, fires, and more. When a user selects a specific disaster category, the app fetches the relevant authority's phone number from our secure database for immediate assistance.
•	Default Calling App Integration: Rather than incorporating a separate dial screen, our app seamlessly integrates with the default calling app on the user's mobile phone. This ensures a familiar and efficient calling experience, allowing users to connect with specific authorities tailored to their current emergency situation.
•	Send My Location: For added safety, users can utilize the 'send my location' button during emergencies. This triggers an auto-generated message containing the user's current location, sent directly to the relevant authority for swift and accurate assistance.
•	Weather Details: The home screen of the application provides users with real-time weather details based on their current location. This feature ensures that individuals are informed about the prevailing weather conditions around them.
•	Disaster Alert Level: Users can stay informed about the current disaster alert level displayed on the home screen. The app categorizes alert levels as high, medium, or low, providing users with valuable information to better assess their surroundings and make informed decisions.
